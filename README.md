# Problem Description and Details
## Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program: Project 1
### Housing price analysis

In this project, I analyze the housing data from New England and Wales.

HM Land Registry publish the “Price Paid Data”, detailed data on the sale prices of properties in England and Wales. Datasets are published monthly with transaction-level information, including price, date, location, property type, property age, tenure duration, and transaction type. 
Datasets are available in bulk in multiple file formats and filtered via the Linked Data API. Please use whatever source is most appropriate to your analysis, acknowledging it appropriately in your report.

#### The UK Government's Statistical Datasets are found here:

It comprehensively covers data from the housing market in England and Wales from 1995 to 2022 and can be used even for commercial analysis.

#### Dataset Description:
A comprehensive description of all the columns in the data can be found here:

In the Jupyter Notebook, the data is cleaned and analyzed to answer the following questions:

- What is the most sold property type in England and Wales?
- Which are the most expensive cities?
- Which property type sold most in the top city?
- What were the effects of crises over the years (the Financial Crash of 2008, Brexit, Covid-19, etc.) on the housing market?
- What are the monthly effects of the sales trends over the years?
- What are the effects when we drill down to the counties? How are the total sales? What is the mean?
