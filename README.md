# Problem Description and Details
## Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program: Project 1
### Housing price analysis

HM Land Registry publish the “Price Paid Data”, detailed data on the sale prices of properties in England and Wales. Datasets are published monthly with transaction-level information, including price, date, location, property type, property age, tenure duration, and transaction type. Datasets are available in bulk in multiple file formats and filtered via the Linked Data API. Please use whatever source is most appropriate to your analysis, acknowledging it appropriately in your report.

**Objectives**
1) Pick a dataset
2) Pose at least three questions related to business or real-world applications of how the data could be used
3) Create a Jupyter Notebook, using any associated packages you'd like, to:

    Prepare data:

    - Gather necessary data to answer your questions
    - Handle categorical and missing data
    - Provide insight into the methods you chose and why you chose them
        
    Analyze, Model, and Visualize:
    
    - Provide a clear connection between your business questions and how the data answers them

4) Communicate your business insights:
    - Create a Github repository to share your code and data wrangling/modeling techniques, with a technical audience in mind
    - Create a blog post to share your questions and insights with a non-technical audience

**Outputs:**

There are two deliverables that are required for project completion:
1. A Github repository for the code
2. A blog post of your findings
